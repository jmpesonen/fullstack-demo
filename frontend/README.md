## Instructions

1. Navigate to this directory and run following commands:
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`, so navigate there to use the program after starting the backend server (auto-launch is disabled). The backend uses a mock data file as "database"; see backend directory for more information.
