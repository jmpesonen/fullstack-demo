# Instructions

1. Navigate to this folder and run following commands:
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. If you want/need to make changes to the code, a rebuild is required with `npx tsc`.

The backend will run at `http://localhost:5000`, unless another port is specified in `process.env.PORT`. A JSON file in `./data/coffeedata.json` serves as "database"; you can empty the file or insert your own data into it if required.
